![Without Mask](/1.jpeg)

What you need to do for run my project;

â€¢	First you need to download TensorFlow Object Detection API https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.13.0 

â€¢	Go to the master/research/object_detection and paste all files & folders of my repository to there.

â€¢	Then you can execute Object_detection_video.py, image or webcam.

â€¢	If you want to train your own model i putted images that i used for training. 

â€¢	You can use any model that you wanna use for training. 

â€¢	I used Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2-COCO It took 10.000 steps(4 hour) to train.

â€¢	https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md

â€¢	If you want to use my labelled images(xml files) your directory must be like C:\tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection.
